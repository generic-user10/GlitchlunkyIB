# Spelunky Classic HD HTML5

![screenshot](screenshots/screenshot_00.jpg)

HTML5 version of [Spelunky Classic HD](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHD).

This version has a bit more bugs but also it has some nice features:
- you can play it in [your browser](https://rawcdn.githack.com/generic-user10/GlitchlunkyIB/570f013fab4c340a8ff433c5f3320370a99c6767/src/index.html)
- [builds for macOS, 64 bits builds for Linux and Windows, ARM builds for Linux (Electron)](https://github.com/yancharkin/SpelunkyClassicHDhtml5/releases)
- touch input on any device that supports it (not only android)

This is just a work in progress but it will be more broken
